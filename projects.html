        Hello, terminal would not have been the right place to show you all

        <p class="projects-text--content">
          <span class="projects-text--highlight">BookMark</span> is a simple app
          that I made for learning
          <span class="projects-text--highlight">flutter</span>, a framework for
          cross platform app development. It is a very simple app, but
          potentially solves a very simple problem, the problem of facing
          trouble inculcating a daily reading habit, and well, sometimes
          forgetting where you left last time reading. <br />

            <i class="bx bxl-github"></i>Code is here
          </a>
        </div>

        <h3 class="projects-text--sub_heading">The Process:</h3>
        <p class="projects-text--content">
          1. <span class="projects-text--highlight">Designing: </span> I
          designed the app first, a proper flowchart of what I wanted, then the
          positioning of different elements, and finally the UI colors and font
          selection. <br /><br />
          2. <span class="projects-text--highlight">Coding: </span> Now that I
          knew what I was looking forward as an end product, the only problem
          was that I was really new to flutter, I didn't know how some things
          are done, like creating a database, which databse to use, persisting
          data, fetching data from the internet etc. This step, as expected took
          the longest trials. <br /><br />
          3.
          <span class="projects-text--highlight">Cleaning the code: </span> Now
          since the code was ready, and app was working, I tried to keep the
          code DRY as much as I could. <br /><br />
          4. <span class="projects-text--highlight">Testing: </span> I shared
          the app among my friends, who then tried the app, and told me about
          some bugs and required features. <br /><br />
          5. <span class="projects-text--highlight">Releasing: </span> Added the
          much-demanded dark mode to the app, and finally published it to the
          play store.
