            1. <span class="project-text--highlight">Designing: </span> I
            designed the app first, a proper flowchart of what I wanted, then
            the positioning of different elements, and finally the UI colors and
            font selection. <br /><br />
            2. <span class="project-text--highlight">Coding: </span> Now that I
            knew what I was looking forward as an end product, the only problem
            was that I was really new to flutter, I didn't know how some things
            are done, like creating a database, which databse to use, persisting
            data, fetching data from the internet etc. This step, as expected
            took the longest trials. <br /><br />
            3.
            <span class="project-text--highlight">Cleaning the code: </span>
            Now since the code was ready, and app was working, I tried to keep
            the code DRY as much as I could. <br /><br />
            4. <span class="project-text--highlight">Testing: </span> I shared
            the app among my friends, who then tried the app, and told me about
            some bugs and required features. <br /><br />
            5. <span class="project-text--highlight">Releasing: </span> Added
            the much-demanded dark mode to the app, and finally published it to
            the play store.
